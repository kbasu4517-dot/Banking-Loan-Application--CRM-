# Business Process Mapping

## Current Process
1. Loan inquiry received via multiple channels (web, phone, branch).
2. Manual entry into separate systems.
3. Loan officer reviews and processes application manually.
4. Status updates communicated by phone or in-person.
5. Branch manager checks reports periodically.

## Proposed Salesforce Process
1. Centralized loan inquiry capture in Salesforce.
2. Automated loan application workflow (approval routing, notifications).
3. Real-time status updates for customers and officers.
4. Dashboards for branch managers to track performance metrics.
